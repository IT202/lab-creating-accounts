#Lab - Creating Accounts

We'll be using a number of professional tools to develop, test, maintain and publish our web pages, sites and apps; in this lab, you'll create accounts for use in class (and beyond.)  We'll learn how to *use* these tools at a later date, and we'll continue to use them (plus many others) throughout the course.

As you create these your accounts, I recommend that you

* Create a professional username, because you may use and share these accounts for years to come; and
* Use your school email address (because it will simplify things for now, and you can change it later.)

These services all offer free accounts which will serve our purposes in class, so if/when prompted, select the **free** option.

## Cloud9 [https://c9.io](https://c9.io)

**Cloud9** is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that we'll initially use for developing and testing static web pages, but it will also be useful when we experiment with different web server applications.

You should have received an email invitation to join our Cloud9 *team* ; by following the instrutions in the message, you'll be able to create a c9 account without have to supply credit card information \(a new practice for Cloud9.\)

Please create your account under your UIC email address and username, and if prompted, select the **free** options.

When your account is removed from the team, your account will revert to a standard free account, and any personal workspaces you created will still be available.

Please make sure you do **not** create any team workspaces - those will be deleted when your team affiliation is removed.

## GitHub [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a version control system, and **GitHub** is a website that allows us to store the repository in the cloud, enablign collaboration and providing a way for developers to show their work to others.

You'll use it to store and maintain your code, and you'll share respositories so that the instructor(s) can review and evaluate your work.

## Heroku [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)

Heroku is a delivery platform; when your work is ready to be seen by the public, you'll push files to your Heroku virtual server, and the world will be able to access your page/site/app.

After you've created those accounts, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/uic.edu/forms/d/1ilFR1pjwoKuNHZd0B6kuuOCaiC-uxNyxPmeLA45mUTo/edit) to submit your usernames to the instructors.

Then, set up accounts for the sites listed below.

***

While those are the primary tools we'll use for *development, maintainence and distribution* of our work, there are some other tools which will be useful.   Please create accounts on these sites also:

###JSFiddle [https://jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/)

JSFiddle is a sandbox where we can quickly test our code, and we can save and share that code.  You'll often see references to JSFiddle examples when researching on StackOverflow.

###StackOverflow [http://stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/)

StackOverflow is a great source for answers to questions on computing languages, tools, concepts and practices.   You'll need to create an account in order to post your own questions;  this site is another way that you can build a reputation in this field.   (StackOverflow is one of several communities - on a wide range of topics - on the larger StackExchange platform.)

###Piazza [https://piazza.com/](https://piazza.com/)

Piazza is a Q & A platform that we'll use for questions and announcements;  the primary use will be for students to help eachother with the work of the class.  You should have received an email to join our Piazza class, but if not, let me know via email.
