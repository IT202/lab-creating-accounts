#Creating Accounts

We'll be using a number of professional tools to develop, test, maintain and publish our web pages, sites and apps; in this lab, you'll create accounts for use in class (and beyond.)  We'll learn how to *use* these tools at a later date, and we'll continue to use them (plus many others) throughout the course.

As you create these your accounts, I recommend that you

1. Create a professional username, because you may use and share these accounts for years to come; and
2. Use your UIC email address (because it will simplify things for now, and you can change it later.)

These services all offer free accounts which will serve our purposes in class, so if/when prompted, select the **free** option.

## Cloud9 [https://c9.io](https://c9.io)

**Cloud9** is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that we'll initially use for developing and testing static web pages, but it will also be useful when we experiment with different web server applications.

You should have received an email invitation to join our Cloud9 *team* ; by following the instrutions in the message, you'll be able to create a c9 account without have to supply credit card information \(a new practice for Cloud9.\)

Please create your account under your UIC email address and username, and if prompted, select the **free** options.

When your account is removed from the team, your account will revert to a standard free account, and any personal workspaces you created will still be available.

Please make sure you do **not** create any team workspaces - those will be deleted when your team affiliation is removed.

## GitHub [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) is a version control system, and **GitHub** is a website that allows us to store the repository in the cloud, enablign collaboration and providing a way for developers to show their work to others.

You'll use it to store and maintain your code, and you'll share respositories so that the instructor(s) can review and evaluate your work.

## Heroku [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)

Heroku is a delivery platform; when your work is ready to be seen by the public, you'll push files to your Heroku virtual server, and the world will be able to access your page/site/app.
